L2 Cache Clock Controller

The L2 Cache Clock Controller provides clock, power domain, and
reset control to a L2-cache for a cluster. There is L2CCC register
region per CPU Cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Can be one of:
		"qcom,8994-l2ccc"
		"qcom,8916-l2ccc"
		"qcom,8976-l2ccc"
- reg:		This specifies the base address and size of
		the register region.
- reg-names:    "l2-base" - string to identify physical address for l2 base.

Optional properties:
- reg:		Second tuple specifies the shared common base address required
		to trigger the L2 SPM out of power collapse. Third tuple specifies
		the acinactm address for L2 SPM to wake up from power collapse.
		Third tuple is required if qcom,use-acinactm is present.
- reg-names:	"l2-common" - string to identify physical address for chicken bit.
		"l2-acinactm" - string to identify physical address for l2 acinactm.
- qcom,vctl-node: Reference to a node that controls the power rails for the
 cluster.
- qcom,vctl-val: The voltage control register value that must be set before
		the caches can be turned on. This would be a required property
		if the target necessitates a voltage rail be turned on before
		turning on the cache.
- qcom,use-acinactm:
		This property indicates if acinactm bit is used to wake up l2
		from low power mode.

Example:

	clock-controller@f900f000 {
		compatible = "qcom,8994-l2ccc"";
		reg = <0xf900f000 0x1000>,
			<0xf911210c 0x4>;
		qcom,vctl-node = <&cluster_node>;
		qcom,vctl-val = <0xb8>;
	}
