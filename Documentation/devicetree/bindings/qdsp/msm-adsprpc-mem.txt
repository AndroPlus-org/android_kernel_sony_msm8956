Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Dynamic Heap Allocator

The MSM ADSPRPC memory device allocates memory, when remote processor(ADSP)
requests memory from application subsystem for use cases where it does not
have enough memory available locally and later release the memory when
use case ends.

Required properties:
-compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-adsprpc-mem-region"
-linux,contiguous-region: A phandle that points to a memory heap where the
dynamic heap memory is allocated

Example:
	qcom,adsprpc-mem {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-adsprpc-mem-region";
		linux,contiguous-region = <&adsp_mem>;
	};
