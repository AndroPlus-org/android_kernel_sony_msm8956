* Qualcomm MSM CPP

Required properties:
- cell-index: cpp hardware core index
- compatible :
    - "qcom,cpp"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
    for the cpp operating in compatible mode.
- reg-names : should specify relevant names to each reg property defined.
  - cpp - has CPP MICRO register set.
  - cpp_vbif - has VBIF core register set used by CPP.
  - cpp_hw - has CPP hardware register set.
- interrupts : should contain the cpp interrupt.
- interrupt-names : should specify relevant names to each interrupts
  property defined.
- vdd-supply: phandle to GDSC regulator controlling VFE & CPP core.
- clocks: list of phandles to the clock controller device and coresponding
  clock names.
- clock-names: name of the clocks required for the device used by the consumer.
- qcom,clock-rates: clock rate in Hz.
- qcom,min-clock-rate: minimum clock rate in Hz, to be set to CPP hardware in
  case dynamic clock scaling based on prevalent streams need lower clock rate.
- bus_master: Flag for presence of CPP bus master
- qcom,cpp-fw-payload-info: Child node for cpp node having infomration on
  cpp firmware payload offsets. This is mandatory node.

Required properties of the child node:
- qcom,stripe-base = Base offset of stripes in cpp payload.
- qcom,plane-base = Base offset of planes in cpp payload.
- qcom,stripe-size = size of each stripe in payload.
- qcom,plane-size = size of each plane in payload.
- qcom,fe-ptr-off = offset from stripe base to fetch engine address
  location in payload.
- qcom,we-ptr-off = offset from stripe base to write engine address
  location in payload.

Optional properties of the child node:
- qcom,ref-fe-ptr-off =  offset from stripe base to reference fetch engine
  address location in payload.
- qcom,ref-we-ptr-off = offset from stripe base to reference write engine
  address location in payload.
- qcom,we-meta-ptr-off = offset from stripe base to metadata address
  location in payload.
- qcom,fe-mmu-pf-ptr-off = offset from plane base to fetch engine mmu prefetch
  address min location in payload.
- qcom,ref-fe-mmu-pf-ptr-off = offset from plane base to reference fetch engine
  mmu prefetch address min location in payload.
- qcom,we-mmu-pf-ptr-off = offset from plane base to write engine mmu prefetch
  address min location in payload.
- qcom,dup-we-mmu-pf-ptr-off = offset from plane base to duplicate write engine
   mmu prefetch address min location in payload.
- qcom,ref-we-mmu-pf-ptr-off =  offset from plane base to reference write engine
   mmu prefetch address min location in payload.
- qcom,set-group-buffer-len = length/size of set group buffer command used for
  hfr.
- qcom,dup-frame-indicator-off =  offset for duplicate frame indicator in a
  batch for frames
