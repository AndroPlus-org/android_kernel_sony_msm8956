* Qualcomm Technologies Inc. NSS HLOS Platform Driver.

This driver communicates with the NSS Firmware, and provides empty buffers for packet-processing to the UBI32 processor.
It also keeps track of sync packets from NSS Firmware.
This driver has 2 sections listed below, one common to all the UBI32 cores and other specific to each UBI32 core.

1. Driver access details common to UBI32 cores

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,nss-common"
- reg-names: Indicates various resources passed to driver by name.
		"nss_fpb_base","clk_ctl_base".
		These correspond to different register bases UBI32.
- reg: physical address and length of the register set for the device.

example:
nss-common@fc800000 {
	compatible = "qcom,nss-common";
	reg-names = "nss_fpb_base", "clk_ctl_base";
	reg = <0xfc800000 0x00001000>,
	    <0xfc400000 0x00004000>;
};

2. Driver access details specific to each UBI32 core.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,nss"
- interrupts: UBI32 to Apps interrupts for Sync/Data Packets and Empty Buffers.
- reg-names: Indicates various resources passed to driver by name.
		"nphys","vphys"
		Refers to TCM and CSM Base Addresses of UBI32 Memory map.
- reg: physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- qcom,id: Unique Identifier for the HLOS block.This field is unique identifier for the core, which is also used as an index for global nss context.
Optional properties:
- qcom,ipv4-enabled: Enables registeration of N2H/PPPoE/ETH handlers, to receive stat sync
	             IPV4 packets from UBI32.
- qcom,ipv6-enabled: Enables registeration of IPV6 packet handlers, to receive stat sync
                     IPV6 packets from UBI32.
- qcom,crypto-enabled: Enables the cryptography feature for the platform.
- qcom,gmac0-enabled: Enables GMAC0 port.
- qcom,gmac1-enabled: Enables GMAC1 port.

example:
nss: nss@e6000000 {
	compatible = "qcom,nss";
	interrupts = <0 229 0x4>,
		<0 230 0x4>;
	reg-names = "nphys", "vphys";
	reg = <0xe6000000 0x1000>,
		<0xe4000000 0x20000>;
	qcom,id = <0>;
	qcom,num-irq = <2>;
	qcom,ipv4-enabled;
	qcom,ipv6-enabled;
	qcom,crypto-enabled;
	qcom,gmac0-enabled;
	qcom,gmac1-enabled;
};
